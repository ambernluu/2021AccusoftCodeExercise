-- Amber Luu 2021AccusoftExercise changelog --

#issues fixed
1. Canvas tabs - created new js file tabs.js and migrated moved pre written relative code there from rightClickMenu.js. leveraged the .inactive to set the idToUse as the active tab to display and manipulate

2. Erase tool - changed toolsModule.Line(event, cx, function() to _toolsModule.Line(event, cx, function() so it was correctly referenced

3. Text tool - utilities is not defined error. removed utilities. from var pos = utilities.relativePos(event, cx.canvas);

4. Upload tool - error cx is not defined. passed cx as parameter in controlsModule.openFile = function()

5. Uncaught TypeError: tools.getVersion is not a function - created function to set _toolsModule.getVersion to "Amber - version 1.0" which is displayed on load
